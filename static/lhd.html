        <h2>Local Hack Day</h2>
        <p>A 12 hour mini-hackathon on Michigan State University's campus that brings together the local hacker community to celebrate building awesome technology. Other students around the world will be hosting their own Local Hack Days, resulting in the largest single day of student hacking ever. Throughout the day, Major League Hacking will provide us with awesome livestreams, chatrooms, and fun activities that you can use to meet students in our community. Whether you're a seasoned hackathon veteran or have never been to a hackathon before, Local Hack Day is the best way to get your foot in the door and start interacting with the hackathon community at Michigan State as well as around the globe.</p>
