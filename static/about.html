        <h2>What is Spartan Hackers?</h2>
        <p>Spartan Hackers exists to foster a community of technological innovation, collaboration, and creation at Michigan State University.</p>
        <h2>What do we do as Hackers?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple definitions of hackers. There are hackers that break into programs and do things the program wasn't intended for. Then there's hackers that are makers, they use parts intended for something else and create something new and unique that does something else entirely. Our club teaches students about different things related to development that isn't touch in the early classes at MSU. We have workshops about building websites, mobile design, using APIs, and more.</p>

        <h2>Hackathons</h2>
        <p>Yes we teach you cool things, and we allow you to make cool personal websites and such. But one of the best things about Spartan Hackers is that we prepare you for hackathons. Hackathons are 48 hour coding events hosted by colleges where you work on a team or 4-5 people and hack together some creation. There's sometimes a theme, and there's a lot of cool prizes for the top creations. Students can create anything to custom APIs to LED arrays that track the stock market.</p>
        <p>Hack on, Spartans.</p>
